## Advancements

This mod adds two advancements&mdash;one for picking up a rabbit with the hat, and another secret one. For all you datapack devs out there, this mod also adds a `mob_hat:mob_hat` advancement trigger with one condition called `entity`, which is an entity condition, the same as `minecraft:summoned_entity`.
